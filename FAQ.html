<h2><a name="question_01">How long will my account be good?</a></h2>

  <div class="instruction">
  <p> It would depend on the type ofthe account. Student accounts are usually good as far as your penn state user ID is active.
  </div>

<h2><a name="question_02">I have two jobs that appear to be hung on lionxf.
</a></h2>
<p> I have two jobs that appear to be hung on lionxf. They claim to be running, but do not have any elapsed time.  I tried to qdel them, but got the following error:
<pre><code>

<h2><a name="question_03">I am using qsub to execute my job. 
</a></h2>
  <p> I am using qsub to execute my job. The status of my job is always C, not Q or R. Might there be something wrong with my PBS script?
</a></h2>

  <div class="instruction">
<p> A state of 'C' means completed - the job went from Q (queued), to R (running), to C (completed), assuming the job wasn't deleted.  Make sure you have
<pre><code>   #PBS -j oe  </code></pre>
<p> In your PBS. After submitting your job, look or the output files/or some error log. Double check your source code, make sure it has an expected output of some sort.

  </div>



 
<h2><a name="question_04"> Disk Quota Exceed Messege 
</a></h2>
<p> When I use packages on Hammer to calculate something, it constantly ended with Disk Quota Exceed.
 Does that mean I should increase the number of cores? Or is there any other problem?
 
  <div class="instruction">
	 <p> Most likely you have exceeded the hard drive disk space assigned to you. The terminal commmand <b>mmlsquota </b> will give you your disk usage and we suggest that you always keep some space available to avoid weird behavious! You have several directories available to you to store files in: your home directory, your work directory, and your scratch directory.  Your home directory has a disk quota (storage limit) of 8 GB.  Your work directory has a disk quota of 64 GB.  Your scratch directory does not have a limit on the amount of storage used, but files that haven't been accessed in 30 days will be automatically deleted. You can access your work directory either through the symbolic link called 'work' in your home directory or at /gpfs/work/your_PSU_user_ID.

  </div>

    
<h2><a name="question_05">How do I cite the RCC web pages and services?</a></h2>

<h2><a name="question_06">
Real time team debugging on our clusters
</a></h2>
I've got a few teammates working on MATLab programs for the first time on the Hammer server. We're using these programs to analyze lots of different types of data in our lab.  Most of the bugs that they run into are quick fixes, so it would be a huge time saver if another teammate could log right into an existing session realtime and help them debug. <br>

 I ask because without logging-in directly to the session, that other teammate would have to then replicate some unlikely error from a saved file in a shared directory.<br> 

I'm thinking that this situation is different from the Group Account solution RCC offers.<br> 
The goal here is to give my research team the ability to open the session of another team member and debug a task/project or pick up where another left off. (I'm not sure if this means realtime collaboration, or even what the implementation limits are.)<br> 

Is a group account an appropriate solution here, or will this on permit shared access to directories and not actual sessions?<br> 



    <div class="instruction">
    What you want to do is different from the group account. 
<p>You can do shared sessions if you connect to Hammer using Exceed onDemand:<br>   http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/remote_display/exceed_on_demand 

The basic flow of operations is:<br> 
1. The person sharing the session opens up an Exceed onDemand session, sets their share list, and enables sharing.<br> 
<br> 
2. The person wanting to join the session then opens Exceed onDemand, authenticates with Hammer, does *not* open a new session but instead goes into the shared sessions listing and joins the shared session. <br> 
<br> 
This is something you should be *very* careful with though. Anything done within the shared session will be done under the credentials of the person sharing the session.  If Innocent Mike shares his session with Bad Joe and Bad Joe thinks it'd be funny to hack into a FBI system using Innocent Mike's session, the feds are going to be coming to see Innocent Mike because it'll look like he did it.  There's a lot of potential for abuse here and I'd recommend that if someone is sharing their session, they don't leave it shared and unattended. To find specific steps on creating and participating in a shared session, you can open Exceed onDemand, select "Contents" under the "Help" menu, and click on the "Sharing X Sessions" subject on the left-hand side Content listing.
 </p>   
    </div>


<h2><a name="question_07">What is a group directory?</a></h2>


    <div class="instruction">
    <p>A group directory will allow the sharing of files since all members of the group can store files in the same location.  It won't necessarily allow the sharing of some session.  It would allow one group member to open some saved file that another group member created and then continue work from the state saved in that file.    
    </div>

<h2><a name="question_08">I have been trying to log in to Hammer using exceed, but it keeps telling me that the credentials I had provided are incorrect. </a></h2>
<p> I reentered my information and still got the same error. Is there anything else I can do?

    <div class="instruction">
    <p> You need to enter your password and user-id together in Exceed or it will give you that msg, please refer to <br> 
    http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/remote_display/exceed_on_demand/   
    </div>

<h2><a name="question_09">Please send me instructions on how to access Gauss software from the LION-XG cluster.</a></h2>
<p> I have access to the HPC cluster, and am interested in using the Gauss program for running some analyses.   

    <div class="instruction">
    You can add Gauss to you runtime environment by running 'module load gauss'.  Once you run 'module load gauss', you can launch Gauss via the commands 'tgauss' or 'gauss'.
    <p>  tgauss is the command-line version of the command.  gauss is the GUI version of the command.  If you're running in batch on Lion-XG, you'll want to use tgauss since Lion-XG is a batch computing cluster. General information on running on Lion-XG can be found at:
     http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/systems
<br> 
You will need to submit your jobs to the PBS job queuing system on Lion-XG for them to run on the Lion-XG compute nodes.  Jobs are submitted to PBS through the use of a PBS script.  An example for Gauss would be: </p>
<pre><code>
   #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1
   #PBS -l walltime=1:00:00
   #PBS -l pmem=1gb
   #PBS -q lionxg-smeal
   #PBS -j oe

   cd /path/to/guass/input/file
   module load gauss
   tgauss -b input.e
</code></pre>
    <p>PBS and PBS scripts are covered in the User Guides linked to above. Gauss examples can be found in /usr/global/gauss/13.0.5/examples. The file 'circular.e' works well for a quick test to see if a PBS script works.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, if you want to use the GUI version of Gauss, we have an interactive cluster called Hammer that you can use. I can send you information about that separately if this is a path you want to pursue. 
    </p>
    
    </div>

<h2><a name="question_10">PBS: job killed: pvmem exceeded limit 4294967296</a></h2>
<p> Do you know what this error message mean? <br>
=>> PBS: job killed: pvmem exceeded limit 4294967296


    <div class="instruction">
     <p> It looks like you had a PBS pmem request that wasn't enough.   
    </div>

<h2><a name="question_11">Terminal or interactive hammer nodes for my big job? </a></h2>
<p> I am trying to run a FEA model on abacus, and is giving me an error message stating that I am exceeding 85% of the memory. I don't have a fine enough mesh to gain any value from my model when I run it beneath this quota.  I believe that there is a way to submit my work using the terminal instead of abacus to request more servers etc.

    <div class="instruction">
    Please use one of the Lion-X cluster to run large models. Hammer is for interactive use only, and is used only to set up the model.
    <p> If your model is very large (300-400 GB of memory required or more), you might want to consider using Lion-LSP, which has 2 nodes with 512 GB and 1 TB of memory respectively.<br>

    The list of the Lion-X systems can be found at http://rcc.its.psu.edu/resources/hpc/. 
    To use ABAQUS with PBS (the job scheduler on the cluster) and run jobs in parallel, please refer to <br> https://rcc.its.psu.edu/resources/software/abaqus/ <br>

<h2><a name="question_12">writing Makefile for various system</a></h2>
<p>  I have c code and would like to make it available for many different systems - at least for Windows. Mac and Linux. I have my own version of Makefile and would like to make Makefiles for these systems. A challenge is that I used a gsl library, which may not be installed in others' computer.

    <div class="instruction">
    <p> We recommend cmake for cross platform compilation; make will be a little tricky on windows. Cmake is far more informative too, and will prompt your end-users to specify and/or install gsl if you indicate in the configuration that this a dependency.    
    </div>


<h2><a name="question_13">fftw mpi on cyberstar</a></h2>
<p> I am a cyberstar user. I am trying to run my code which uses a parallel fftw transform.
After I load fftw3 and openmpi module, the mpicc compiler still complains about can not find fftw3-mpi.h header file.<br>
Is there any other module I should load before running such a program?


    <div class="instruction">
    <p> Generally one needs to specify the path to include files using the CFLAGS variable or similar; the mpicc wrapper compiler will only take care of header and libraries germane to openmpi.    
    </div>


<h2><a name="question_14">Can I run Avizo&#174; directly from my laptop? </a></h2>
<p> I am a student in the Geosciences department. I have recently started a project measuring samples on a CT scanner and I need Avizo&#174; to analyse the data.<br>
On the Penn State downloads website it says that I need to contact your group before obtaining a license. I am happy to provide any information you need for this to happen.
On the license terms it says that Avizo can be installed on a local computer.<br>
Does this mean I can install the programme on my personal laptop?


    <div class="instruction">
    Yes, you can install the Avizo&#174; software on your personal laptop, as long as you will be using it only for Penn State related academic or research work. Please see info below and let us know if you have any questions. 
    <p>


    VSG Avizo&#174; software is available for use by any Penn State faculty, staff, or student, for academic research or teaching purposes. Any commercial use, including individual commercial consulting or similar, is prohibited. <br>

The Avizo distributions for Windows, Mac and Linux are available for download at: "downloads.its.psu.edu". They are located under the "Technical Applications" area. You will need to add the following lines to the license info area when you install and first run the software:
<pre><code> 
SERVER lm.rcc.psu.edu 27006 37006
USE_SERVER
</code></pre>
You can access that server from any system that is using a PSU IP address. <p> 
The licenses server will not serve a licenses to non-PSU IP addresses. If you wish to use Avizo on PSU-owned computers that are off-campus you must use the Penn State Anywhere (VPN) <br>
http://aset.its.psu.edu/vpn <br>
service when on these off-campus networks. The license server will recognize this as a PSU connection and will be able to grant a license.<br>
Please let us know if you have any problems with the installation.

<h2><a name="question_15">Is my Job suitable for LionLSP machines?</a></h2>


    <div class="instruction">
     <p> The total amount of the memory fixated for a particular job depends on how many processors is requested for that job as well. If, let's say, ppn=6 so that job in all wants 120 GB.  That is suitable for LSP. In fact any job requiring memory above 100 GB is a suitible job for LSP. <br>
     We ask that if your job doesn't reuire that much resources you make that slot availbel to those who mihgt need it and can't afford waiting in the quue for long.
     </p>
    </div>



<h2><a name="question_16">The referenced account is currently locked out </a></h2>
<p> When I try to log in to Anvil, it says "The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to." <br>
How do I remedy this?


    <div class="instruction">
     <p> Please send us an email with your PSU account ID so we get it unlocked. Your account will lock after unsuccessful login attempts (userid@dce.psu.edu)   
    </div>



<h2><a name="question_17">I think I have reached the maximum storage on my account</a></h2>
<p> I think I have reached the maximum storage on my lionxi space.  I guess this is around 10GB.  Is there any way I could request more space?  Possibly another 5-10 GB?  Thank you,

    <div class="instruction">
    <p> Your home dir is usually the one that runs out of free disk first, every PSU affiliate also has a work dir which has another 64GB of storage, also scratch is available for temp storage, Please check the information at <br>
    http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/systems/hammer/ <br> for more information
    
    </div>



<h2><a name="question_18">Is there any policy which restricts the number of processes that can be run on the Cyberstar system</a></h2>
<p> I would like to know if there is any policy which restricts the number of processes that can be run on a limited set of nodes/cores on the Cyberstar system, submitted through pbs?
For e.g., Can one launch 512  processes on 64 cores [which theoretically should be okay], or if there is a policy in place which will kill such a job?

    <div class="instruction">
     <p> There is no policy in place where a job that's using more processes than requested cores will be automatically killed.  However, if you're going to run more processes than the number of cores that you requested, you will need to make sure that you're not using resource that's been allocated to someone else.  For example, if you request one processor core per node and then run 24 processes on each node, your 24 processes are going to fight with other people's processes on those nodes for CPU time.  In this case, we'd kill your job because you're using more resource than you requested.  The best way to avoid this would be to request all processor cores on the nodes you are requesting since in that case there would not be any processes from other users on those nodes to worry about.   
    </div>



<h2><a name="question_19">Asking for nodes on the Cyberstart cluster</a></h2>
<p> I'm running a couple of huge jobs on the CyberSTAR,  If I have to run say 512 processes on 64 cores, I should better request for nodes=8:ppn=8 rather than just nodes=64. I hope this is the exact way to go.

    <div class="instruction">
    On CyberSTAR, you'll have to  be a bit more specific than just nodes=8:ppn=8 since CyberSTAR has three different node types in it.
    <p> What you probably want is: <br>

    nodes=8:nehalem:ppn=8

    <p> Since the Nehalem nodes are the ones with eight cores per node ( there are also five Nehalem nodes still reserved for SSCL).  If you don't specify the 'nehalem' feature, your job could also run on the Shanghai or Westmere nodes.

<h2><a name="question_20">Package version update</a></h2>
<p> Would it be possible to add the latest version of fsl (v5.0, released September 2012) to hammer?  The latest version has some tools that I need that are not available in the version currently on hammer

    <div class="instruction">
     <p> We would be happy to take care of this type of updates, especially when the new version has a significant added capability, for our penn staters.

<h2><a name="question_21">Avizo&#174; Install on a PSU computer lab</a></h2>
<p> We are trying to install a standard version of Avizo&#174; 7.1 on one of the computer labs on campus. Please help and let us know how we can obtain a license to finish the installation? 

    <div class="instruction">
   <p> Please send us an email and we will send your the Avizo&#174; licensing info.

<h2><a name="question_22"> Potential dead node</a></h2>
<p>I am having issues with lionx-hershey. <br>
Series of events:
I was using Matlab and it appeared to freeze, though the resource monitor showed no usage.  I let it sit for about 5 min with no change.  I tried to close matlab and it would not close.  After about 10 minutes I tried to log off the system, but then everything froze and I could not do anything.  After about 5 minutes of that I closed my connection window.  For a period I was unable to login (get login failed message), but that happened with Hammer as well so I am not sure if this is a local issue, or a larger one.<br>

Current state: <br>
Now, I am now able to login, but I just have a black screen and the mouse cursor is an x for a long time.  The desktop will eventually load after 5-10 minutes, but everything is very slow (1-5 min to respond to any clicks or commands).<br>

I am not sure if there is a way to reset my account (do the server equivalent of restarting my desktop computer for my user).


    <div class="instruction">
    <p> Please send us an email and we will look into that particular node, account that you've problems with.

<h2><a name="question_23"> Is possible to get into a previous session where I've closed my connection? </a></h2>
<p> I was wondering if it is possible to get into a previous session through the remote desktop connection on Windows so that if I am running something on Matlab and it continues after the desktop connection ends, I can find it again. <br>

With Remote Desktop, it is possible if you note which hammer node you are on and then connect to that specific node, eg. hammer12.rcc.psu.edu.

    <div class="instruction">
    <p> First we would recommend using Exceed since it will automatically connect you to the disconnect session, see connecting to Hammer using Exceed onDemand: http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/remote_display/exceed_on_demand

<h2><a name="question_24">I cannot open NASTRAN on the hammer cluster.</a></h2>
<p> I cannot open NASTRAN on the hammer cluster. I load the module "module load nastran", after to run nastran I input the command "nastran mynastran_model.bdf" I get an error saying the file does not exist.

Is this the correct procedure to run nastran?


    <div class="instruction">
    <p> Since NASTRAN is a solver only the command "nastran mynastran_model.bdf" instructs NASTRAN to solve the model named mynastran_model.bdf. If you do not have any model named mynastran_model.bdf in your current directory you will get the error message saying the the file does not exist. 

    To set up a model you can solve with NASTRAN, you will have to use PATRAN, which is the pre and post processor of NASTRAN. <br>
    To use PATRAN, just load the patran module ("module load patran"), then run the command "patran". You can find a tutorial on NASTRAN/PATRAN at <br>

<h2><a name="question_25">Run parallel jobs interactively on LionX machiens</a></h2>
<p> I wonder if there is a way to run parallel jobs on LionX machines interactively. I want to test/debug my code and I need to run short jobs which take couple of minutes without waiting long time in the queue.

    <div class="instruction">
    <p> Indeed there is; check out our pbs guide here: <br>
    http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/system_utilities/pbs/ <br>
    particularly the section on interactive use.
